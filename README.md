Config-Perl
===========

This is the distribution of the Perl modules
[`Config::Perl`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::Perl) and
[`Data::Undump::PPI`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Undump::PPI).

They are Perl extensions for parsing configuration files written in a subset
of Perl and (limited) undumping of data structures (via PPI, not eval).

Please see the modules' documentation (POD) for details (try the commands
`perldoc lib/Config/Perl.pm` and `perldoc lib/Data/Undump/PPI.pm`) and the
file `Changes` for version information.

Installation
------------

To install this module type the following:

	make
	make test
	make install

If you are running Windows, you may need to use `dmake` or `nmake`
instead of `make`.

Dependencies
------------

Requirements: Perl v5.6 or higher (a more current version is strongly
recommended) and several of its core modules; users of older Perls may need
to upgrade some core modules. The CPAN module "PPI" is also required.

The full list of required modules can be found in the file `Makefile.PL`.
This module should work on any platform supported by these modules.
